## [Unreleased]

### Added
* Manual steps now run as fast as possbile. I.e., if a viewer is connected, stepping is interrupted to render the UI at 30Hz. (This now also applies to running with unbound real-time, which previously was interrupted at 30Hz regardless if any viewer was connected).

### Fixed
* re-added setting realtime settings via ros param or in the mujoco model xml.
* Add missing install of mujoco_ros's `config` and `assets` directories (#28).

## [0.7.0] - 2023-08-15

### Added
* Updated to MuJoCo library version 2.3.6.
* Added a `step(num_steps=1, blocking=true)` public function./
* Unit tests for plugin loading and resetting and running callbacks correctly.
* Now automatically building with AVX instructions, if possible.
* CMake tooling borrowed from deepminds MuJoCo repo and https://github.com/osjacky430/ros_pkg_template/.

### Changed
* Moved from static namespace to object oriented application model.
* `get_load_requeststate` service topic changed to `get_load_request_state`.
* Renamed namespaces:
* * `mujoco_ros_sensors` -> `mujoco_ros::sensors`.
* * `mujoco_ros_control` -> `mujoco_ros::control`.
* * `MujocoSim` -> `mujoco_ros`.
* * `MujocoSim::detail` -> moved mostly to private access members, namespace is not necessary anymore.
* * `MujocoSim::jointName2id` -> `mujoco_ros::util::jointName2id`.
* Node launchfile arg changed from `visualize` to `headless` for consistency.
* Moved most contents of `MujocoSim::rendering::VisualStruct` into `mujoco_ros::MujocoEnv::offscreen`.
* Renamed `MujocoSim::rendering::CameraStream` -> `mujoco_ros::rendering::OffscreenCamera`.
* `env_id` members were removed from messages, since env_ids are no longer used.
* Added more compiler warnings (see [CompilerWarnings.cmake](./cmake/CompilerWarnings.cmake)).

* Missing roll back of collision functions to default on reload caused calling unloaded code.
* An invalid model will not result in trying to reload indefinitely anymore.

## [0.3.1] - 2023-01-17

### Added
* Service call for reset.
* Unit tests for single environment library functions.
* Added support for multi-DoF for initial positions and velocities (#3).
* Added support for supplying a model as rosparam (generated e.g. by urdf2mjcf).
* Ensures compatibility with MuJoCo 2.2.2.
* Adds interprocedural optimization compile policy.
* Service call to get/set bodys with freejoints.
* Service call to set geom properties (mass, friction, size, geom_type).
* Allows using wall time instead of ROS time (set `/use_sim_time` to false).
* Adds additional "unbound" speed mode to run as fast as possbile.
* Adds offscreen rendering RGB, depth, and/or segmentation mask images.
* Added `eval/train` mode settings.
* Added `admin_hash` for permission checks in eval mode.


### Changed
* `SINGLE` and `PARALLEL` mode are distinguished by a mode variable in shared code instead of requiring separate lib function calls.

* **cmake**: Renamed mujoco_INCLUDE_DIR -> mujoco_INCLUDE_DIRS.
* Time is set to 0 on reset.
* Adds more general debug info.


### Fixed
* Not counting multiple steps in CPU sync.
* Step counting depending on `num_sim_steps` enabled or disabled.
* Wrong declaration of `publishSimTime`.
* Pose quaternion is now normalized before application to prevent setting invalid quaternions in `SetModelState`.

* slow_down not being applied.
* Missing test world.


### Performance Improvements
* Improved multi-threading concept for `PARALLEL` mode.


### Refactored
* Init function improvement and cleanup.
* Improved `Get/SetModelState` service:
  - Flags are now used to specify which parts of the state message are used to update the state.
* Mutex usage.
* Rendering functionallity making it much more runtime efficient.

## [0.3.0] - 2022-06-10

### Added
* Added configurable initial joint velocities.
* `MujocoEnv` uses namespacing coherent with ROS namespaces.
* Added `lastStageCallback` to define behavior for plugins at the very end of a simulation step.

### Fixed
* Moved mjENABLED_ros/mjDISABLED_ros definitions to non-static context (#2).
* Removed `collision_function` typedef (duplicate of `mjfCollision`).

### Removed
* Removed `runContactFilterCbs` since setting a contact filter callback fully overrides default behavior.
